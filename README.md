# Chrome-Extension

As an aspiring Full-Stack developer honing my skills in JavaScript, I have developed a dynamic extension tool that enables users to seamlessly store and manage URLs of valuable resources or interesting finds. Using JavaScript and localStorage, this tool allows users to input URLs manually, capture URLs from the active Chrome tab with a simple click, and save them for future reference. It's a fantastic way to effortlessly organize, track, and revisit important links
